These files contain the code for studying the basic kinematics of our signal and background.
These are made using the TTree MakeClass function. 

The signal process is: stop-stop production where stop -> top N2, top -> b W, N2 -> H/Z N1. hhn1n1_1k_200_1.C and hhn1n1_1k_200_1.h files are for events where mass_stop=1TeV, mass_N2=200GeV and mass_N1=1GeV. 

We also have ttbar single lepton event (background to our signal). Same basic kinematic variables are plotted as for signal.


Then, we have other variables like MT, MT2, Mlb. These are plotted using MadAnalysis5. They are found in the file stop_topN2_ana.cpp stop_topN2_ana.h
